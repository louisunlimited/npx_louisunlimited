This is my attempt at creating an interesting personal portfolio showcasing my skills and projects.

You can directly book an appointment with me with Calendly or view all my social pages in one place.

I have also setup GitHub actions to automatically deploy latest npm package to npm registry so you can always install the latest version of my package.

Feel free to play around with the package and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

## Usage

```bash
npx npx_louisunlimited
